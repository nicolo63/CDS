    "- A web-based **interactive computational environment**\n",
    "- In-browser editing for code, with automatic syntax highlighting, indentation, and tab completion\n",
    "- The ability to **execute code from the browser**, with the results of computations attached to the code which generated them\n",
    "- Displaying the result of computation using rich media representations, such as HTML, LaTeX, PNG, SVG, etc\n",
    "- In-browser editing for rich text using the Markdown markup language, which can provide commentary for the code, is not limited to plain text\n",
    "- The ability to easily include mathematical notation within markdown cells using LaTeX, and rendered natively by MathJax\n",
    "- The Jupyter Notebook has become a popular user interface for cloud computing, and major cloud providers (SageMaker, Colab, Azure) have adopted Jupyter or derivative tools as a frontend interface for cloud users"

    "- **Notebooks:** documents that contain the inputs and outputs of an interactive session, as well as additional text that accompanies the code, but is not meant for execution\n",
    "    - The official Jupyter Notebook format is called `nbformat` and uses the open standard file format JSON\n",
    "- **Kernels:** Interfaces between **notebooks** and **programming languages**. When a code cell is executed, code that it contains is sent to the kernel associated with the notebook. The results that are returned from this computation are then displayed in the notebook as the cell’s output\n",
